This app listens for iBeacons and displays web content based on the closest beacon.  Ranging is initilized every time the app startes and lasts for 20 seconds.  Ranging can be triggered again by tapping the button in the upper right.  Beacon content is managed in an online database using parse.  To see a demonstration, program two beacons with UUID: A64A513A-96DF-4117-AFE4-6835A1D1285E.  Program one with a Major: 5 and Minor: 1 and the other with a Major: 7 and Minor: 1.  The first will display the Robin homepage and the second my linkedIn profile.
